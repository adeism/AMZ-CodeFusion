    - Exclude hidden files and folders.
    - **NEW!** Exclude comments (`/* ... */`) to create cleaner code datasets, focusing on the core logic.
- **Detailed Logging:**  Comprehensive logging to track the code dataset generation and archiving process, including skipped files and folders.
- **Summary Reports:**  Includes a summary header and a combination summary in the output file, detailing code files processed, dataset size, and skipped items.
- **Zip Archive Creation:**  Optionally create a `.zip` archive of the output code dataset or archive for easy sharing and distribution.
- **Multi-threaded Processing:**  Leverages multi-threading to accelerate the processing of large codebases.
- **Open Output File:** Automatically opens the generated code dataset or archive file after processing.
- **Skipped Items Detail:** Option to include detailed lists of skipped folders and files in the output summary for complete transparency in dataset creation.

     - Optionally includes timestamp and file size based on settings.
   - The code content itself, optionally with line numbers.
   - If syntax highlighting is enabled, code is wrapped in Markdown code blocks.
